# Indian Startup Analysis Dashboard

A production-grade Business Intelligence dashboard that analyzes India’s startup ecosystem using structured funding data. This project converts raw investment records into strategic insights through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and interactive visualization.

It is designed to replicate a real-world analytics workflow — from messy data to executive-level insights.
